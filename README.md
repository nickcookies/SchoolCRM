# SchoolCRM
A fullstack CRUD application 

This CRM school application is built using Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and REST API.

Node.js: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

Express.js: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. It is a client-side scripting language that is executed by the browser.

CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. It is used to control the layout and design of web pages.

HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It is used to structure the content and layout of web pages.

REST API: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services. It is used for creating, reading, updating and deleting data from a server.

The CRM school application provides the following features:

Student Management: Allows the user to add, edit, and delete students from the system.
Class Management: Allows the user to add, edit, and delete classes from the system.
Enrollment Management: Allows the user to enroll students into classes.
Report Generation: Allows the user to generate reports on student performance, class performance, and attendance.

To use the CRM school application, the user must first set up a server and install Node.js and Express.js. The user can then run the application by running the following command: "node server.js" in the command line. The application will then be accessible on the specified port.

To access the REST API endpoints, the user can make HTTP requests to the specified endpoint URLs. The API supports GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.

Please refer to the API documentation for detailed information about the endpoints and the parameters required for each request.

This application is a minimal example, it is important to consider security, scalability, and error handling when building a production-ready application.
